## ‚ú® Features

This project is packed with features that simulate a real-world e-commerce website:

* **Dynamic Product Catalog:** Products are loaded dynamically from a JavaScript data source on multiple pages, including the homepage, category pages, and search results.
* **Multi-Page Navigation:** A complete multi-page architecture with dedicated pages for:
    * Homepage with featured categories
    * Product Category Pages (Jackets, Hoodies, etc.)
    * Product Detail Pages with similar item recommendations
    * Full Collection Page
* **Interactive Search:** A fully functional search bar in the header that takes users to a dedicated search results page.
* **Shopping Cart:** A persistent shopping cart that uses `localStorage`. Users can:
    * Add items from any product grid or detail page.
    * View all items in a dedicated cart page.
    * Update item quantities.
    * Remove items individually.
    * Select/deselect items for purchase, with the total bill updating in real-time.
    * "Select All" and "Deselect All" for convenience.
    * "Empty Cart" with a confirmation prompt.
* **Wishlist:** A persistent wishlist that also uses `localStorage`, allowing users to save items for later and view them on a dedicated wishlist page.
* **Simulated Checkout Process:** A complete, multi-step checkout flow:
    * Users proceed from the cart to a checkout page.
    * The page includes a form with live validation for numeric-only fields.
    * A custom pop-up warns users if they try to leave the page accidentally.
    * Upon "payment," the cart is intelligently updated (only purchased items are removed), and the user is redirected to the homepage with a confirmation pop-up.
* **Newsletter Subscription:** A functional newsletter sign-up form in the footer that:
    * Uses **EmailJS** to send a styled, on-brand "Thank You" email to the new subscriber.
    * Provides instant on-page feedback, confirming the subscription.
* **Interactive UI & UX:**
    * **Theme Toggle:** A dark/light mode toggle with custom sun/moon icons that saves the user's preference.
    * **Animated Background:** A futuristic, interactive particle animation that appears on all pages.
    * **Pop-up Notifications:** A custom "Item added to cart!" pop-up provides immediate user feedback.
    * **"Pressed" Button Effect:** All major buttons have an active state that gives them a satisfying, tactile feel when clicked.

## üöÄ Setup and Installation

To run this project locally, simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser. For the best experience (especially with features like the newsletter), it is recommended to use a simple local server.

1.  If you have VS Code, you can use the **Live Server** extension.
2.  Alternatively, with Python installed, you can run `python -m http.server` in the project's root directory.
3.  Navigate to `http://localhost:8000` (or the provided server address) in your browser.
